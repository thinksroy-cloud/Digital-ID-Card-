# Anik Portfolio (local dev)

This repository contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold to run the `ANIK.JSX` component.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Add your photo at `public/photo.jpg` (create `public/` if missing) or update the path in `src/ANIK.JSX`.

3. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be served by Vite; open the URL shown in the terminal.
